# Common objects

This package is contains default MTProto objects for stuff like key generation, setting up session, etc.

Package generated by [tlgen]() command, and _manually_ reviewed, which  means that we generated this files once and _will not_ regenerate them again (only manual edits).

Instead, we are using this lib as gold standard of generating objects from TL schemes.

Current **official** TL schema of this package is located [here](https://core.telegram.org/schema/mtproto).

This package currently fully implements [this](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto/blob/master/schemes/mtproto.tl) TL schema of MTProto protocol.
